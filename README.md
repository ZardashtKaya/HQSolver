Solvers Info
------------

****NOTE: All solvers logic are in `solvers` folder****

Solver Name  | File         | Short description
------------:|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Naive        | `naive.py`   | Uses Google CSE API, checks how many times the answers appear on the results page
Google       | `gsearch.py` | Similar to Naive, but doesn't need CSE API, and it uses more advanced techniques for predicting answers
Wikipedia    | `wiki.py`    | Searches wikipedia for words that are in answers, if these pages exists, checks the probability of that answer
